@item 1. Brace commands
Эти команды начинаются с @@ followed by a letter or a word, followed by an
argument within braces.  For example, the command @code{@@dfn} indicates
the introductory or defining use of a term; it is used as follows: @samp{In
Texinfo, @@@@-commands are @@dfn@{mark-up@} commands.}

@item 2. Line commands
These commands occupy an entire line.  The line starts with @@,
followed by the name of the command (a word); for example, @code{@@center}
or @code{@@cindex}.  If no argument is needed, the word is followed by
the end of the line.  If there is an argument, it is separated from
the command name by a space.  Braces are not used.

@item 3. Block commands
These commands are written at the start of a line, with general text on
following lines, terminated by a matching @code{@@end} command on a
line of its own.  For example, @code{@@example}, then the lines of a
coding example, then @code{@@end example}.  Some of these block commands
take arguments as line commands do; for example, @code{@@enumerate A}
opening an environment terminated by @code{@@end enumerate}.  Here
@samp{A} is the argument.

@item 4. Symbol insertion commands with no arguments
These commands start with @@ followed by a word followed by a
left and right- brace.  These commands insert special symbols in
the document; they do not take arguments.  Some examples:
@code{@@dots@{@}} @result{} @samp{@dots{}}, @code{@@equiv@{@}}
@result{} @samp{@equiv{}}, @code{@@TeX@{@}} @result{} `@TeX{}', and
@code{@@bullet@{@}} @result{} @samp{@bullet{}}.
