GENDSA(1)                           OpenSSL                          GENDSA(1)

NAME
       openssl-gendsa, gendsa - generate a DSA private key from a set of
       parameters

SYNOPSIS
       openssl gendsa [-help] [-out filename] [-aes128] [-aes192] [-aes256]
       [-aria128] [-aria192] [-aria256] [-camellia128] [-camellia192]
       [-camellia256] [-des] [-des3] [-idea] [-rand file...]  [-writerand
       file] [-engine id] [paramfile]

DESCRIPTION
       The gendsa command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter
       file (which will be typically generated by the openssl dsaparam
       command).

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
           Output the key to the specified file. If this argument is not
           specified then standard output is used.

       -aes128, -aes192, -aes256, -aria128, -aria192, -aria256, -camellia128,
       -camellia192, -camellia256, -des, -des3, -idea
           These options encrypt the private key with specified cipher before
           outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.  If none of these
           options is specified no encryption is used.

       -rand file...
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for
           OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       [-writerand file]
           Writes random data to the specified file upon exit.  This can be
           used with a subsequent -rand flag.

       -engine id
           Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause gendsa to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

       paramfile
           This option specifies the DSA parameter file to use. The parameters
           in this file determine the size of the private key. DSA parameters
           can be generated and examined using the openssl dsaparam command.

NOTES
       DSA key generation is little more than random number generation so it
       is much quicker that RSA key generation for example.
