PKEY(1)                             OpenSSL                            PKEY(1)

NAME
       openssl-pkey, pkey - public or private key processing tool

SYNOPSIS
       openssl pkey [-help] [-inform PEM|DER] [-outform PEM|DER] [-in
       filename] [-passin arg] [-out filename] [-passout arg] [-traditional]
       [-cipher] [-text] [-text_pub] [-noout] [-pubin] [-pubout] [-engine id]
       [-check] [-pubcheck]

DESCRIPTION
       The pkey command processes public or private keys. They can be
       converted between various forms and their components printed out.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format DER or PEM. The default format is
           PEM.

       -outform DER|PEM
           This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning
           and default as the -inform option.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard
           input if this option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a
           pass phrase will be prompted for.

       -passin arg
           The input file password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard
           output if this option is not specified. If any encryption options
           are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for. The output
           filename should not be the same as the input filename.

       -passout password
           The output file password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -traditional
           Normally a private key is written using standard format: this is
           PKCS#8 form with the appropriate encryption algorithm (if any). If
           the -traditional option is specified then the older "traditional"
           format is used instead.

       -cipher
           These options encrypt the private key with the supplied cipher. Any
           algorithm name accepted by EVP_get_cipherbyname() is acceptable
           such as des3.

       -text
           Prints out the various public or private key components in plain
           text in addition to the encoded version.

       -text_pub
           Print out only public key components even if a private key is being
           processed.

       -noout
           Do not output the encoded version of the key.

       -pubin
           By default a private key is read from the input file: with this
           option a public key is read instead.

       -pubout
           By default a private key is output: with this option a public key
           will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the
           input is a public key.

       -engine id
           Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause pkey to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

       -check
           This option checks the consistency of a key pair for both public
           and private components.

       -pubcheck
           This option checks the correctness of either a public key or the
           public component of a key pair.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the pass phrase on an RSA private key:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

       To encrypt a private key using triple DES:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

       To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

       To print out the components of a private key to standard output:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -text -noout

       To print out the public components of a private key to standard output:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -text_pub -noout

       To just output the public part of a private key:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem
