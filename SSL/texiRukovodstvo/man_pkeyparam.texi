PKEYPARAM(1)                        OpenSSL                       PKEYPARAM(1)

NAME
       openssl-pkeyparam, pkeyparam - public key algorithm parameter
       processing tool

SYNOPSIS
       openssl pkeyparam [-help] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-text]
       [-noout] [-engine id] [-check]

DESCRIPTION
       The pkeyparam command processes public key algorithm parameters.  They
       can be checked for correctness and their components printed out.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or
           standard input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write parameters to or
           standard output if this option is not specified.

       -text
           Prints out the parameters in plain text in addition to the encoded
           version.

       -noout
           Do not output the encoded version of the parameters.

       -engine id
           Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause pkeyparam
           to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified
           engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set
           as the default for all available algorithms.

       -check
           This option checks the correctness of parameters.

EXAMPLE
       Print out text version of parameters:

        openssl pkeyparam -in param.pem -text

NOTES
       There are no -inform or -outform options for this command because only
       PEM format is supported because the key type is determined by the PEM
       headers.
