NAME
       subuid - the subordinate uid file

DESCRIPTION
       Each line in /etc/subuid contains a user name and a range of subordinate user ids
       that user is allowed to use. This is specified with three fields delimited by
       colons (“:”). These fields are:

       ·   login name

       ·   numerical subordinate user ID

       ·   numerical subordinate user ID count

       This file specifies the user IDs that ordinary users can use, with the newuidmap
       command, to configure uid mapping in a user namespace.

       Multiple ranges may be specified per user.
